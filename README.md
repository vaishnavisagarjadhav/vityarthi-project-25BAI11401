Hi! Welcome to my Money Tracker
I made this to help me not spend too much

What do you want to do?
1 - Add money I got (income)
2 - Add money I spent (expense)
3 - See all and how much I have
4 - Bye bye, finish

Choose number 1 2 3 or 4: 1

--- Add Income ---
What is this money for? (like Salary): Allowance
How much? $30
Okay! I added $ 30.0
Now you have $ 30.0

[... more transactions ...]

Choose number 1 2 3 or 4: 3

*** All my money things ***

 + 30.0   - Allowance
 - 12.5   - Ice Cream
 - 8.0    - Movie Ticket

Total money now = 9.5
Good! You have money left
